Recruitment task

1) Please have a look into Emag\Lib\Getter\HttpGetter class and implement getData() method so it downloads the data
from an URL defined in filePath class variable.

2) Implement Emag\Lib\Parser\EmagSchemaPriceParser::parse() method so it extracts products data from an XML file
and returns it with given format.

See TODO in each method.

If you want, you can extend this task and add saving data into database - it doesn't matter which database you will choose. 

Feel free to use external library or popular tools. 

Good luck!
